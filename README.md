# ASPIDAfiletransfer
Send files from some device to your computer via internet(python+html)

First make sure you have Python installed, it will NOT work without it.

Place ASPIDAt.bat, file_server.py and sender.html in the same folder(THEY MUST BE IN THE SAME FOLDER FOR THIS TO WORK)

Next run ASPIDAt.bat and when you start the server, Windows Firewall will ask you for permission, make sure to allow both for Private and Public Networks because it will not work if you do not allow permission.

Final step is to go to any browser on any device and type in "yourIPAdress":8080 and you should be able to upload files. 
Exact instructions will be available in the terminal when you run it. 

P.s. I know .html page looks like scammers wet dream, but i hate working with html and it was made for good part by AI(i am not ashamed of admitting it) I HATE HTML!!
